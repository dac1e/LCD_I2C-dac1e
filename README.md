# LCD_I2C
Arduino library to control a 16x2 LCD via an I2C adapter based on PCF8574

Important. When connecting the LCD to an Arduino board with of 3.3V supply voltage you need an I2C voltage transformer chip like TXS 0104E. Refer to wiring diagram. ![Wiring Diagram](https://github.com/dac1e/LCD_I2C-dac1e/blob/doc-dac1e/extras/LCD_I2C_wiring.pdf) Otherwise you could damage the microcontroller on the Arduino board.
